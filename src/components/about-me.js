            Hi, I am learning how to code, I am self taught, I started learning towards the end of 2021, 
            <br />
            <br />
            i really enjoy front end development, currently I know Html, Css, JavaScript and react.js.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have a real passion for problem solving and getting things to work in general, I would also say I have a feel for design.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm a pretty fast learner, and I plan on going a lot deeper into front end development.
